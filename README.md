# 👩🏾‍🎓 Week05 Bootcamp2018c Project: Student List

Created an applicationn that would allow a teacher to take  the attendance of her class but also keep track of who is out or sick.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

the bulk of this project came in the javascript however because of recent prjects that ive worked on this one was . bit easier to tackle becuse it was a similar approcach to a projedct id recently cpompleted

## Optimizations
given more time id like to see if i could make the code dryer

## Lessons Learned
learned how take other projects and implement lessons ive learned to make the task at hand alot easier on myself
